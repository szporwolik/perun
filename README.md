# Perun for DCS World

This toolset extracts data from DCS World server and sends information to the local Json file and UDP port for further processing. 

Provided windows app puts received UDP packets to MySQL database. Additionaly Perun windows application can be used to merge LotATC and DCS SRS data in one database making Perun for DCS World wannabe ultimate integration tool for the server admins.

However, this software is intended to be used by experienced users - the output is Json data and MySQL; you will need to process/display it yourself.
